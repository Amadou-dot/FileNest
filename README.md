# File Storage Project
This is my first project that will involve an extensive backend to work.
I was just browsing around and thought it was a fun project to start.
It's going to need a lot of stuff that I'm not familiar with but learning those tools will prove very helpful in the future

## How to run
As of now only the frontend is implemented.
I used vite for the frontend:
1. Clone this repo or Download and extract it
2. Using your terminal, Navigate to the folder "client"
3. Type "npm i" or "npm install" and press enter
4. When the command completes, Type "npm run dev" and press enter
5. Go to http://localhost:5173

## To be Implemented
- User Privacy and Security: Secure authentication and encryption
- Access Control: Define user permissions
- File Upload and Download
- Search functionality
- Limitations: File sizes, number of files
- Responsive design
